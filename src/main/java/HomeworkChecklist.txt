 SHORT ANSWERS
    // TODO FOR HOMEWORK: Answer each question, and note many don't have a 'right answer' so just answer honestly
    [ ] What is the purpose of a constructor
         ANSWER HERE: to execute code upon instantiation of a class

    [ ] This project uses 'inheritance' for each shape, since they all have 'BaseShape' as their parent.
        In your own words define what you believe 'inheritance' means.
        ANSWER HERE: inheritance is a method to gain access to methods and variables in a child parent class

    [ ] Research the concept of 'Object Oriented Programming (OOP)', and write down the 4 principles of 'OOP'.
        ANSWER HERE:
            1) Encapsulation
            2) Inheritance
            3) Abstraction
            4) Polymorphism

    [ ] What are some advantages of 'inheritance'
        ANSWER HERE:
        * reuse of code (DRY)
        * code standardization


    [ ] In the ShapeFactory.java class, there are two methods both called CreateShape.
        One method takes in 3 parameters - Shape Name, length and height
        One method takes in 2 parameters - Shape Name and length

        This concept is called 'polymorphism', research 'polymorphism' and write below why Factory used 'polymorphism'
        ANSWER HERE: Since the triangle and the square only need one measurement for the length, there is no need for a whole new function, the same one can be used that accepts only one length.

    [ ] Does this project ever cover the concept of 'Abstraction'? If yes, how so?
        ANSWER HERE: yes, the abstract BaseShape class

    [ ] Does this project ever cover the concept of 'Encapsulation'? If yes, how so?
        ANSWER HERE:yes, there are variables that are only accessible within the class, and there are public get and set methods

    [ ] Why did you need to 'override' the 'area' and 'perimeter' methods in 'EquilateralTriangle.java' but not the
        'Square.java' and 'Rectangle.java'?
        ANSWER HERE: the area requires calculating the height of the triangle, and the perimeter is adding three sides instead of four. different functionality was needed

    [ ] We made 'ShapeTests' differently than we did 'SquareTest', 'RectangleTest' and 'EquilateralTriangleTest'
        A unit test is testing a single unit and generally that means by classes in java.
        'SquareTest', 'RectangleTest' and 'EquilateralTriangleTest' are all unit tests.
        'ShapeTests' was testing with each shape as a generic 'BaseShape' instead of the previous shape classes.
        Is 'ShapeTests' a unit test of 'ShapeFactory.java'?
        ANSWER HERE: I would say not, usually they test one thing, like triangle perimeter, or square area, instead of all the things in one test.
